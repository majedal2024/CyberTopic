the argument of well what if the password is exposed a year later could just as easily be well what if its exposed a month later when there is a 90 day rotation cycle  different windows of risk  so why not make the cycle a week? because its painful
unless youve gone passwordless via security keys  biometrics etc  clearly this negates the need to use the password with such frequency thus reducing the opportunity for compromise  there may still be a password  e g   fallback from biometrics   but exposure is much less 
geez theres some debate about this one! mostly support but also some misunderstanding so lets fill some gaps   firstly  password managers dont solve this problem  not when youre talking about the credentials to logon to your pc  thats a rare case where you need to type it
 plgelinas  mrpeanutforpres  datsteves  jasonskiles fills some gaps  creates other gaps  as for the 1 year later argument  what about 1 week later? same answer  thats why we have mfa now  in the last  we didnt  mandated rotation has become a legacy remnant of a bygone era 
 nerdfunk how do you logon to your pc when the password manager is on the pc?
the timing worked out such that i launched a book right before my wedding and honeymoon  which means ive barely had time to look at how its all been going  so how is it? were pushing various edits  would love to hear from people that are reading it

not going to be able to go much further with wechat without access to the service  its not clear why this is bundled in with tiktok  afaik theyre both independently operated entities  government control aside   i find it odd theyre presented together  and its not clear why 
oh ffs  what an abysmal  completely pointless ux   
little trickier verifying as everything is run through the mobile app  no probs  ive got a wechat account from previous time spent in china  but i used to just login with mob number and now it wants a password  ok  ill just recover the accou   
 wechatapp lets look at the largest files instead  the top 17 all beginning with "user friend request 202209032229 [int]"  obfuscating anything im not confident isnt personal  the urls return avatars and the nicks seem viable at a glance   
 wechatapp the 3 "wechat" prefixed files seem like the most logical place to start  but theyre all empty save for column headings   
onto the next data set which is alleged to have from  wechatapp and is sits alongside the tiktok files  heres whats in this corpus   
this is so far pretty inconclusive; some data matches production info  albeit publicly accessible info  some data is junk  but it could be non production or test data  its a bit of a mixed bag so far

lets look at it the other way   is there anything in there thats obviously fake? yes  in "record paypal order trade 202209032247 csv"   
still need non public data for verification  so lets look at "record paypal order 202209032247 csv"  sku translation here is "15 yuan 100 tiktok live viewers" and ip addresses are private range  bit inconclusive   
checking out "tiktok video 202209032248 csv"  the first 2 ids lead to videos that are no longer available  but the 3rd one returns a hit for an active vid with matching description  again  scrapable data though       
 rom so far  yes
but this is all publicly accessible data so it *could* have been constructed without breach  lets look further   
lets pick a random one a few thousand lines in  yep  that also matches     
the first entry has an id that matches this video  and a description that also lines up  
is it legit? lets see whats verifiable  starting with the "tiktok video username parse record 202209032248 csv" file  looks to be largely vietnamese lgbt content with ids  which means we can at least see if they line up with publicly accessible videos     
a 237mb sample was provided which includes the files listed in this gist   
"theres another db in the oracle server were in  its called "cabinet cloud" and its 34gb in total  no idea why its here and what its for  but were releasing it because we dont think well need it  heres the video of the tables "  
with the preface that all this is "alleged" at this time  theres a post on a popular hacking forum from 12 hours ago making some pretty major claims   
well this is going to be interesting   has  tiktok us been breached?

i think its kinda hilarious that my password purgatory blog post actually made some news  as much as boing boing is news   
 guaymar it depends  ive seen others argue that theres not a legal right to contact those individuals directly
 c tolkien probably not an account per se  rather just a record of you having completed a survey
 8vicat  briankrebs ive only got anecdotal evidence on this  but i think most is more like a small percentage
ive now removed the "unverified" flag and will update this thread as more news breaks
lastly  as much as id like to see questionpro acknowledge this breach and disclose expeditiously  im sympathetic to them  someone has broken into their system  exfilled their data and held them to ransom  its a serious criminal offence  and theyre the victim 
what makes a breach like this extra tricky for questionpro is that its not their customers whove had their pii exposed  its their customers customers  is it their responsibility to notify impacted parties  or dubai malls and the dutch ticket sellers et al?
4  its a long email but its similar to the last one  a service specific email alias and a time stamp bang on when the guy said he received the survey   
why the common may 12 dates? its unclear  but i would assume its some sort of post collection processing  i dont think its of much relevance here  but the coincidence was worth noting 
3  then theres this one from the dubai mall  the source data shows exactly what the sender of this email said it would  a "wifidubaimall" alias on his domain  and that time stamp? may 12 this year  well after his mall visit  but only 6 minutes off the time stamp on my record   
further  other fields in the data set clearly line up with the nature of the email   
2  another email i was forwarded was in french  quebec  from 18 feb last year  their time stamp in the data? 18 feb 2021   
his data also had a username in it which he explained in his response to me  "[redacted] was my giffgaff  uk mobile phone network   subsidiary of o2   telefonica  username   this and the fact the survey was about giffgaff tends to point to it being related"
1  someone kept this email from 25 march 2011  clearly from questionpro  in a field in the breach called "custom3" is a time stamp of    25 march 2011   
heres where it gets more interesting  following loading into  haveibeenpwned and notifications going out to my impacted subscribers  i had multiple people reach out and offer to help verify  suddenly  all the dots started lining up  here are 4 solid examples 
the date is a bit odd though   thats an email address i havent used for years so why am i seeing it from only a few months ago? remember that date   may 12   because it will come up again later 
but hey  because its me im happy sharing my data here  the only thing that makes any sense at all to me here  other than my own email address!  is the "  source ts ms" field  the 1652320074907 epoch time is may 12 this year  but i cant correlate that to anything   
further  its the sort of service where many people would have used it without even knowing they were on a questionpro site  including me  who was rather surprised to get this   
the nature of the data made it hard to attribute to a source as there are no clear indicators of origin and the only thing tying it to questionpro was the word of the person who sent me the data  without a statement from them confirming the origin  it was impossible to attribute 
a thread on the "alleged" questionpro breach  firstly  in  lawrenceabrams article he said "they are currently determining whether a data breach occurred"  they havent acknowledged a breach occurred  havent been in contact with me and i dont know if theyve even seen the data

 ravenzbb only loaded for the facebook leak
 vxunderground thank you    the kind words are greatly appreciated!
 ravenzbb thats what it does not based on email address  but thats not something i want to do with passwords
 ravenzbb can you clarify what you mean by that?
so there we have it  another little piece of the data breach puzzle  i hope this helps anyone who is wondering why on earth their data was in this incident
the breach was not only referenced in the article linked to in the original  haveibeenpwned tweet  but also in this facebook post  the incident wasnt extensively covered anywhere  but it certainly wasnt hard to find references to it   
were also talking about data thats being extensively traded on a popular hacking forum  not on the dark web  not via private encrypted channels  but on an easily accessible forum where its freely downloadable by the public 
this is why disclosure is necessary but in this case  its messy  these guys need to be notified by jb hi fi as theyre the ones they entrusted with their data  but that cant happen until jb hi fi  and how many others?  is notified by tuned global 
good on those guys for actually having emails from a decade ago! frankly  i can barely remember what i signed up to last week so there are inevitably going to be a lot of confused people receiving  haveibeenpwned notifications and even more receiving    crickets 
which also lines up with the experiences of others  for example with  beaugiles   
so  with  pantsofpies help we pulled the thread on this by looking back at his source record and there we have it   jb hi fi   
what this all means is that ive started seeing messages like this from  haveibeenpwned subscribers who hadnt heard of the org and didnt know why their data was there   
this piece gives you an idea of what that looks like  we powered the first telco streaming service in australia with aapt and emi and the provided multi year executions for companies such as samsung  universal music  jb hi fi and coles

unit 42 says the attack uses tactics that are similar to those used by apt29 in the past but that it was not enough to fully attribute the attack to them   however  "these techniques demonstrate that users of the tool are now applying nation state tradecraft to deploy brc4 "
a new report by  unit42 intel explained that a recent phishing campaign distributed iso files containing windows shortcuts disguised as cvs   when opened  the shortcut installs a brute ratel payload on the infected device   brute ratel is a red team tool similar to cobalt strike

 falconmick if you consider whats required to trigger a fall event and also consider all that things that *arent* falls and try to reduce that rate of false positives  im sure there are many genuinely serious events that wont get detected  a gentle fall  for example 
 krcourville its amazing to think about just how much stuff personal devices like this might be able to detect in future
 mario81 no  he got an immediate call from emergency services and obviously confirmed he was ok  i imagine that until he canceled it  it was treated as the same incident and flagged as not needing a response 
 name  expired  rafeirodalinha i doubt adding fall detection to a watch is contributing to the carbon footprint
 name  expired  rafeirodalinha except that was dedicated hardware built for a sole purpose for those who needed it  having a mass market consumer product that does this is a whole different story 
later  he went out and obviously hadnt deactivated the fall state so i continued to get alerts as his location changed  imagine he was in an ambulance  on his way to hospital; how valuable would this have been?! just amazing stuff!  
he was fine and obviously just didnt select the prompt in time to dismiss the alert  but what if he wasnt? this could literally have been life saving  as much time as i spend in tech  i still marvel at what stuff like this can do 
how cool is that his technology  my father tripped over last night while wearing his apple watch and triggered fall detection  as an emergency contact  i got this text message with his location on a map and he got a call from emergency services

its not clear how traceable patient data is back to individuals but at face value  it seems highly likely sensitive personal information can be matched to individuals  given the sensitivity of the breach  id prefer to see ctars   ndis provide more commentary on that 
a significant portion of the email addresses belong to staff at care providers rather than individual patients  many of the impacted care providers are already subscribers of the domain search service in  haveibeenpwned and have now been notified of their exposure 
the email addresses alone have been added to  haveibeenpwned and flagged as a "sensitive" data breach  that is its not publicly searchable and you need to use the notification service to verify control of the address or domain its on before knowing if youre in this 
this includes information such as suicide attempts  mental health issues  drug use  both prescription and illicit   violent behaviour  sexual abuse  this has been published to a hacking forum and accessed by an untold number of people  its horrendous 
"personal  health and other sensitive information about you is stored in ctars and is accessible to your care provider so that  alongside you  decisions about your care needs can be made"
ctars provides a cloud service used by care providers to record information relevant to ndis participants  think of organisations providing support to those with disabilities and funded by the government scheme; theyre users of ctars  the data they provide the platform includes 
background first  the ndis is our national disability insurance scheme down here in australia  its a gov agency that supports some of our most needy  specifically those with serious disabilities that require help

oh ffs! just checked an old email address i havent used in ages and found this  thanks  troyhunt  bastard   
for people suggesting [insert favourite online cloud service here]  its a no for 2 reasons   1  a lot of this data is breaches of 3rd parties i dont want stored on someone elses services  encrypted or not  2  i get 20mbps up so backing up multiple tbs aint gonna happen
 unsafemedicine theres some stuff i just dont want on someone elses computers  plus im pretty limited with only 20mbps up
 twentysox  ubiquiti  malwaretechblog ive been plugging it for 6 years!  
 thecrmninja hmmm  might have to look into that again  theres just no improvements in sight for the existing wired infrastructure
 kwuchu you betcha 
now im thinking i just get a proper rack mounted  synology nas  make that the primary unit and use the other 2 desktop units i already have as backup devices i rotate offsite  maybe staying in the  synology ecosystem is easiest? something like this   
 thecrmninja needs to be physical given the bandwidth constraints we have here  20mbps up 
i should add  i have a couple of  synology nas units that are the source  working data  if you like   this is about taking backups of those onto physical media i can then take offsite  i presently do that with some  westerndigital wd elements drives  but running out of space 
back to the g4 doorbell pro  people asked about quality at night so heres a before and after  the old doorbell first  parked car in centre of frame  and the new one second  definitely a lot sharper  especially when you look at the quality around the gate   
 staustellsimon apparently can do data as well  but im nowhere near a cable run so wouldnt make sense  wireless is now really reliable on it  i added an external ap in near line of sight months ago  so power alone is fine 
 zadankzadank  haveibeenpwned the breach was 2019  data was obviously acquired before that date and could stretch back many years
 w6oody short run  light weight
need to rejig my backup strategy as im running short on capacity  im talking backups to physical media  not cloud  which i regularly rotate offsite  ideally up to about 15tb  any suggestions? something similar to this   
 iamrenganathan  esesci  mgmresortsintl storage is cheap  parsing out and discarding old data is expensive

 seanwrightsec but its an article on linkedi oh
looks pretty slick too  dirty wall aside    
now that its all sorted the devices are drawing &gt;20w and everything is online as expected   
except that was old and now it *is* in the new ui  youve just gotta know where to find it  as others in threads i found commented   ubiquiti *really* needs to get parity in the new ui and kill off the old one  ive had multiple similar cases where i couldnt find something   
into the usw flex docs  into the fine print and theres this  but where is it in the unifi controller? googling shows lots of stuff about it being in the old ui and not in the new ui     
just blogged  weekly update 297  
weekly update is up! loads more data breaches loaded; the mgm grand one; ubiquiti g4 ptz  g4 doorbell pro &amp; in wall wifi 6  
so  if you receive a notification today *in addition to one you received in feb 2020*  this is why  better that than missing people imho 
i dont want people missing notifications  especially when you could argue that simply by virtue of this now being a much larger data set circulating much more broadly  *many* people dmd me the link  that its also noteworthy for people who were previously notified 
this is a bit of an edge case and its very rare to have a breach so significantly updated years later  i *could* start to store the number of aliases impacted by a domain notification then send a new one if that number later changes but again  this is a  very  rare edge case 
that would leave a gap; you could have been monitoring a domain in 2020 and received a notification that n alises on there were impacted  now  that number could be much higher  and probably is  and you wouldnt be notified a second time 
if i loaded an additional 22m addresses into the existing breach then  haveibeenpwned subscribers in *that* set would receive notifications  if either individuals or domain subscribers received a notification 2 years ago  they *wouldnt* receive another one now 
so  as far as  haveibeenpwned is concerned  do i update the existing breach or add this a new one? i originally wrote this thread planning to do the former  thought about it then changed my mind  heres why 
there are differences  but they dont make the data sets incompatible; data i loaded in 2020 was pipe delimited  the data above is obviously json  the 2020 data has what looks like an internal identifier not present in this set  but other data for the same addresses is identical 
ive concluded that this is highly likely to be the same incident from 2019  the total row count is *identical* to what was being sold years ago

im live!   
going live with my  belated  weekly update in a few mins! loads more data breaches loaded; the mgm grand one; ubiquiti g4 ptz  g4 doorbell pro &amp; in wall wifi 6  
its only a few days until winter  will we be ok?!     
 larsklint congrats! whats your favourite colour and mothers maiden name?
which is where this little guy comes enough  not much love on the packaging compared to the other items in this thread! but hey  its just a little injector   
however  chuck on a 60w injector between the switch and the usw flex and youve got yourself enough juice to run 46w in total  which should be plenty  
that meant running the cabling for the second ap and second cam all the way back to the  mains powered  switch  which aint pretty   
this unit is presently powered by poe  802 3at from a switch which gives it a maximum of 20w and almost all of that is being drawn just to power the switch  cam and ap   
 m the lion not from  ubiquiti  youd need to source one from elsewhere
one remaining project for today  a few weeks ago  i went through a big tidy up of all my av gear including building shelves  organising cables and running conduit  i wanted to run the 2 roof cams and 2 root aps from the usw flex  but needed more power   
this *looked* like it was going to be really easy  until it lost bluetooth  id walked with my ipad to another room so it may have dropped  but then it couldnt reconnect  all sorted via the web interface and adopted the traditional way   
to match the wallpaper  ive got a neat cover on the existing unit so it blends in  guess what? the new units are bigger  ok ari  youre getting wifi 6 mate!  
onto the next thing  in wall wifi 6  ive put a bunch of previous gen in wall units in the house as theyre awesome to extend wifi to each room with dedicated aps  having a fully wired house with existing jacks in each room made this a breeze   
and now its all tied back into  home assistant  the old doorbell always played a sound on the sonos and snapped a pic  but now with 2 cams i can snap a pic of the face  *and* the feet  or "package"  as it may be   
 ryancrawcour you can decide  i run it permanently
and heres the new one today  i havent tweaked any brightness or contrast settings on either  certainly not the new one and dont think i ever did the old one    
just for a more equitable comparison  heres the old doorbell video from exactly this time yesterday with very similar weather conditions   
 nz liam only until the install was complete 
whoa   this is a *remarkably* better camera  old one on the left  new one on the right  it just captures so much more light   
success!  
smaller screws  job done! both old and new doorbell had recesses on the doorbell side  but that just wasnt enough  to be fair  these arent  ubiquiti provided screws  sparky fitted them to the fabricated panel when the first doorbell was installed   
moment of truth hey  why wont it fit? old bracket had recesses for screws  new one doesnt   
this probably could have been made easier  
it would have been really nice if  ubiquiti but the holes in the same location! that seems like an easy win  working on the assumption some people will want to upgrade their doorbell   
 schnabel45 lets come back to that soon  gotta get to it further down this thread
 mukul k1 thats awesome  except my ability to run data to there is near zero! unless i wirelessly uplink an ap with a secondary port but itd need to run off a poe injector  im making my life hard now! 
 schnabel45 apparently   
 rsobers for power  yes  not sure about data though
 mukul k1 saw that  not clear if the poe option can also run data though  or am i missing it somewhere?
 dmeeze  ubiquiti no aircon in that room  its presently 24c outside  26 in that room and 30 in the cabinet without the rack fans running  they get triggered at 35  so far never had a heat related issue 
 matt gerlach thats standard  new one is pro
 zedpointfive yep  i know  just havent seen a need for it
this is actually a *much* larger unit than the non pro  abut assuming it runs the same power and connectors  tbc  but i think yes  it should be an easy retrofit  
the light is apparently triggered by motion which is cool  but its also something i already do with  home assistant  each  ubiquiti cam is a binary sensor that raises a motion event and i just turn on lights as required  very cool for security   
anyway  back to the pro doorbell  it adds a second camera to look down at packages as well as a light to illuminate them  theres also a fingerprint reader and customisable display  its kinda packaged up like an iphone  which is nice   
which is cool  because its very easy to scroll through and see whats been going on  also  i have very long arms   
this means having the ability to scroll back through motion events which can be detected as being caused by humans  vehicles or something else  you can configure "zones" in which motion needs to occur to trigger the event   you end up with an event timeline like this   
incidentally  all these  ubiquiti cams are part of the unifi protect ecosystem and they record *locally* so everything is on prem  but remotely accessible  i run a rack mounted unvr with 2 disks in raid1  bottom item in the rack   and 2 empty bays for future expansion   
its caught some pretty dodgy stuff before too  most of which i wouldnt reproduce publicly  some of which i make an exception for   
with the exception of the dodgy metal mounting bracket  a legacy of the old doorbell form factor  which i now intended to fix   this has been a really sweet bit of kit   
the g4 pro doorbell  ive had the g4  non pro  doorbell for ages now and its been awesome; 1080p full time recording  including audio   full duplex comms and integration into  home assistant so my sonos plays doorbell sounds when it rings   
going to need to go just under that arrow facing forward in order to maximise coverage when it pans  thatll be a sparky job to mount  weatherproof and run more cat 6 to so the g4 ptz story is to be continued  meanwhile  
  microsoft to roll out security defaults to millions more worldwide    cybersecurity  infosec  
now  where to put it? theres a g4 pro and a usw flex ap at arrow so 2 cat 6 cables there already  kinda dont want to lose the g4 pro as its fixed on the entrance; the ptz will pan and tilt so may face other directions  itll look kinda obnoxious hanging off a white wall too  
pretty slick looking mounting kit too  some heavy duty hardware in there  installation looks pretty simple though     
found the cover in the top of the box so yeah  thisll hang off the side of the house somewhere rather than in a corner  need to figure out how im going to feed it poe++ as well   
crikey  this thing is massive  my large hand for scale   i guess thats what pan  tilt and 22x optical zoom does to size  but damn  this feels seriously imposing   
it comes in a bag  and a *very* heavy base  must be several kg right there   
so  what is a g4 ptz? its the top of the tree camera that sits above the g4 pro  4k cam used for the photo in my tweet of my back yard just now  and looks totally kick arse    
waiting for me on arrival home was a care package from  ubiquiti  lets start unboxing and full disclosure  theyve sent me a bunch of bits  including these ones  since i spent up big  re did my whole house and decided i loved the gear     
had a beautiful night away in brisbane with  charlottelyng  first time the sun had come out in what feels like ages  woke up this morning  looked at the security camera back home and immediately packed our bags  holidays are great  but coming home is amazing   
 porter7851  charlottelyng  lamborghini bit of a mixed bag  but our other cars are also very low profile and never had a problem over hundreds of thousands of kms

the targeting of the infosec community has been increasing over the past year   in 2021  we saw the lazarus hacking group to hack researchers devices via vulnerability collaboration  fake security companies  and trojanized ida pro   be careful out there   
the iocs for this campaign are  cve 2022 24500 exe  e8cb47abf1b565b17f387004e2d6de04f196ce45de2f0eb0a9416152eabb0d1c cve 2022 26809 exe  6c676773700c1de750c3f8767dbce9106317396d66a004aabbdd29882435d5e0  the gzip compressed ps injector can be found here   
from a deobfuscated  net version of the malware shared by  aucyble   we can see a powershell script is launched to execute another gzip compressed powershell script that installs the cobalt strike beacon  
when executed  both pocs would pretend to exploit a remote device  even checking if the remote port was open  but would ultimately fail   
news of these exploits started spreading on twitter and hacker forums  such as xss  but were quickly spotted to be fake and installing malware   
last week  a threat actor published alleged poc exploits for the windows cve 2022 24500 and cve 2022 26809 vulnerability on github   these respositories are now down  but an archived github page can be seen below

last may  the ftc reported that $80 million has been lost to cryptocurrency investment scams since 2020  as the advisory was published last may  this number has likely significantly increased since then   
while it may be hard to believe anyone would fall for these scams  cryptocurrency giveaways and investment scams have stolen a tremendous amount of money   recent ark invest scams earned threat actors $1 3 million  likely more now  since the campaign started 
like all cryptocurrency investment and giveaway scams  the site pretends to display withdrawals of earnings to entice visitors to make deposits of their own   however  these withdrawals are randomly created by javascript   
for example  in the video below of a ted talk wth  elonmusk  the deep fake uses a ridiculous script promoting the fake bitvex crypto investment platform   we love how it was altered to start with elon saying  "hi  how are you in a great mood?"   
the videos are legitimate interviews but have been altered using deep fake software to change what is said during the interview and to modify the mouths movements to try and appear realistic 
starting this month  threat actors began hacking youtube channels to promote a fake crypto trading site called bitvex   to promote the platform  deep fakes of elon musk  cathie wood  brad garlinghouse  michael saylor  and charles hoskinson were posted as youtube videos or shorts

read about dev 0504 and other prominent ransomware threat actors in this blog  which explains the ransomware as a service affiliate model and disambiguates between the attacker tools and the various threat actors at play during a security incident   
many of dev 0504s high profile attacks are attributed to revil gang or blackcat ransomware group  this attribution masks the actions of the set of the attackers in the dev 0504 umbrella  including other revil and blackcat affiliates 
dev 0504 has deployed at least six raas payloads since 2020  shifting payloads when a raas program shuts down  however  the practice of clustering activity based on ransomware payload alone can obfuscate the threat actors behind attacks

we highly recommend organizations to secure internet facing systems  including timely application of security updates and building credential hygiene  microsoft defender for endpoint detects sysrv k and older sysrv variants  as well as related behavior and payloads 
like older variants  sysrv k scans for ssh keys  ip addresses  and host names  and then attempts to connect to other systems in the network via ssh to deploy copies of itself  this could put the rest of the network at risk of becoming part of the sysrv k botnet 
a new behavior observed in sysrv k is that it scans for wordpress configuration files and their backups to retrieve database credentials  which it uses to gain control of the web server  sysvr k has updated communication capabilities  including the ability to use a telegram bot 
these vulnerabilities  which have all been addressed by security updates  include old vulnerabilities in wordpress plugins  as well as newer vulnerabilities like cve 2022 22947  once running on a device  sysrv k deploys a cryptocurrency miner 
sysrv k scans the internet to find web servers with various vulnerabilities to install itself  the vulnerabilities range from path traversal and remote file disclosure to arbitrary file download and remote code execution vulnerabilities 
we encountered a new variant of the sysrv botnet  known for exploiting vulnerabilities in web apps and databases to install coin miners on both windows and linux systems  the new variant  which we call sysrv k  sports additional exploits and can gain control of web servers

we updated the microsoft defender for endpoint threat analytics report on socgholish to include the new ttps  customers can use the report to determine the impact of this threat on their network  and the hunting queries to locate related artifacts and attacker behavior 
the new c2 domains include upstream[ ]fishslayerjigco[ ]com  xen[ ]hill family[ ]us  apps[ ]weightlossihp[ ]com  host[ ]integrativehealthpartners[ ]com  platform[ ]windsorbongvape[ ]ca  widget[ ]windsorbongvape[ ]com  lines[ ]fasttracklegal[ ]com  priority[ ]expugements[ ]com 
multiple incidents involving socgholish with hands on keyboard attacks led to lockbit ransomware as the final payload  in these cases  the cobalt strike loader was launched with rundll32 via these command lines   
in february  we also observed a shift from pe payloads to powershell scripts delivering cobalt strike  the scripts were obfuscated beacons that reached out to the ip address 185[ ]250[ ]151[ ]213 and downloaded additional payloads to supplement hands on keyboard attacks 
secondary payloads were usually dropped in the programdata folder  the unique  modified dll exports observed throughout these campaigns were launchcolorcpl  wimdeleteimagemounts  dxgireportadapterconfiguration  reportadapterconfiguration  and createinstance 
cobalt strike loaders varied between signed and unsigned portable executable  pe  files and dlls launched with rundll32  the beacons followed a unique profile with distinct watermark  jitter  sleeptime  and werfault exe as spawnto process 
these campaigns led to the deployment of tools like powersploit  rubeus  powershell nishang modules  privesccheck  and sharppack  their notable features include the use of blister loaders and tampering with legitimate dlls where export was modified to launch cobalt strike 
socgholish  a malware distribution network  started updating its tradecraft toward the end of 2021 with new c2 infrastructure almost every month  additional ways to deploy cobalt strike  and the use of publicly available tools for discovery and credential dumping

 stuartblang very different though when its about disrupting an economy rather than directly penalising innocent civilians
 0gtweet technically  yes  but its never happened before and once that precedent is set  it changes things forever well beyond the scope of just this one situation
 stuartblang theyre different targets though  its a perfectly valid question to ask what impact it might have in terms of a deterrent to russia  but tesla  apple et al also have to ask what the broader impact is  and its massive  this is why it wont happen 
 foxalfabravo the ability exists  but its never be exercised for the same reason tesla never will
 stuartblang from teslas perspective  theyll never set a precedent of killing someones purchase solely on the basis of geopolitics  imagine the impact across the globe  this isnt something that would only impact russia 
 tehstu  brandonlive not sure if that construct exists outside th e us  pretty sure it doesnt here  there  are other ways to repossess a security
 0gtweet even then  the precedent would be set that a foreign auto maker can hobble your purchase
a case in point  how many people would buy a chinese car if the same ability existed and tensions escalated further with taiwan? which countries would you *not* buy a vehicle from if it might become political leverage in the future?
i love the idea of sanctions on russian govs and corps  but killing the cars private citizens have gone out and bought is an absolutely terrible idea that would have all sorts of adverse negative consequences

a demonstration of how the login forms would look when using novnc and browsers running in kiosk mode can be seen below   
any credentials that are entered could then be stolen by injected js  burp suite  or other http proxies   furthermore  as the user logged in and completed mfa auth directly on the attackers server  the attacker could later use the same vnc session to gain access to the account 
to conduct a phishing attack  a threat actor can send emails with links that automatically log the target in to the novnc server via the browser   once connected  they are shown a login form for gmail  microsoft 365  etc directly within their browser 
instead   mrd0x came up with the clever idea of using the novnc software and browsers running in kiosk mode to display legitimate login prompts directly on an attackers server  but shown to victims within their own browsers 
however  existing phishing attack frameworks utilizing man in the middle attacks were detected by google  who blocked logins  furthermore  sites like linkedin are reportedly deactivating accounts detected to be authenticated via mitm reverse proxy attacks   
while on a penetration test engagement  security researcher  mrd0x needed to conduct a phishing attack against employees accounts configured with mfa

this sucked  im done with breaches for the day 
ive been in touch with law enforcement  this isnt new and its been shared broadly in the hacking community for some time now  but you can bet its been carefully filed away for future reference and that data points in there will line up with others in future investigations 
however  hundreds of domain subscribers just got  haveibeenpwned notification emails that are going to lead to *very* awkward discussions about what folks are using corporate resources for  imagine being the person that has to explain the nature of this site to hr   
there are gov email addresses in there  education facility addresses  fortune 500 addresses  did the owners of them genuinely sign up for the site? some probably not  others definitely so  thats part of the reason i flagged it "sensitive" and not publicly searchable 
theres no other way to put this  thats one seriously fucked up site and verifying this breach was the least fun thing ive done for a long time  the private messages in particular   reading the sorts of things people are just casually requesting   is absolutely repulsive

enom data center migration knocks hundreds of sites offline    ionut ilascu  
rt  ncsc  in this weeks threat report  multiple sonicwall vulnerabilities    
other threat actors who reviewed the data said it was fake and from an old leak   the ukraine government attributes these attacks to russia  with the goal of undermining the confidence in the ukrainian government   
soon after  new accounts were made on raidforums to leak what was claimed to be data stolen from ukraines diia site  run by the ministry of digital transformation of ukraine   
the websites were defaced to show a message stating that citizens personal data was stolen and shared publicly online   
earlier this week  15 websites belonging to various ukrainian public institutions and govt agencies were compromised  defaced  and subsequently taken offline   
microsoft says the malware is launched on systems using impacket commands like   cmd exe  q  c start c \stage1 exe 1&gt; \\127 0 0 1\admin$\  [timestamp] 2&gt;&amp;1

as the data is intentionally overwritten by static data and the mbr locker component does not offer a way to enter a decryption key obtained after paying a ransom  like other mbrlockers offer  microsoft believes that this is a intentional data wiper disguised as ransomware 
the second stage  stage2 exe  is downloaded from discord and corrupt all files in windows that match the file extensions shown below   microsoft says it overwrites files with "a fixed number of 0xcc bytes  total file size of 1mb  " meaning its not decryptable   
the first component  stage1 exe  is an mbr locker that destroys the mbr and causes a ransom note to be displayed on reboot instructing the victim to pay a $10k ransom to the 1avnm68gj6pgpfcjuftkata4wlnzg8fpfv bitcoin address

 jarodmellor thats true  its a bit hard to tell where the traffic is from as cloudflare sits in front so i only see edge mode ip addresses  although i could use that to work out the region  anecdotally  a lot of those urls do come from what wed consider lower socioeconomic countries 
 peter joelving it was oddly satisfying for such a small win 
 jarodmellor i believe theyre all pretty dated by now  the routers   some of the sites are obviously still well trafficd though  that surprised me 
i watched 4+ hours of the hearing today  yes  i was very bored   the ruling is really the only thing that matters at this time  here it is   
thats it   hes gone  by unanimous decision  at that

web skimmers are being hosted on the cloud more often  partly because this can make them appear more legitimate to victims  learn about this and other recent trends in web threats     
 tapenvyus itd be an outbound link from the blog post on it
 peter joelving thatd be high effort with very low success  i actually had someone with a compromised router contact me  we worked out the problem and he went and got a new one  so  yeah  thats one down!
let me know if youre interested in any further stats or have other good ideas about what to do with this data  i feel like theres a lot more that can be done with this  no  i dont mean injecting my own cryptominer into it! 
im honestly surprised to see this number still so high because ive effectively killed any site still running the miner  for example  if youve got a blocker rejecting coinhive this will look normal  check your console    
now  consider that only ~20  of all requests these days are served insecurely  that suggests a heap of compromised devices still out there  
many of these are sites still infected with the cryptominer  but a bunch are there due to compromised routers injecting the miner in transit  that only happens when the request is over the insecure scheme  of which 45  of those i logged with a referrer are 
over the last month  i logged 19m requests for the coinhive domain  there are over 84k *unique* domains   host ips in the referrer header  sites embedding coinhive   heres what they all are  some nsfw

 snubs tl;dr   a tiny slice of the population is unvaxed and impacted by gov rules  impact on them  and anybody isolating  is more inconvenience than depriving them of lifes essentials  testing is our biggest issue  imho  and thatll improve once rat supply increases  the end 
 snubs as for food supplies  the vast majority of the country is located in areas with both grocery and pre prepared meal deliver  such as uber eats  so no  nobody is going hungry through lack of access to food  plus  all the usual amazon and other delivery services for misc things 
 snubs problem is  where do you get the home test from? and if you need a pcr  can you even get in? the vast bulk of society is double vaxed and has mild symptoms if positive so inevitably theres a *huge* number of unreported cases out there 
 snubs this means the gov has dramatically reduced criteria for pcr tests; a close contact in most states is now someone who lives in the same house *or* spent &gt;4 hours in a confined space with a positive case  they need to isolate for 6 days  home test then emerge if clear day 7 
 snubs availability of testing is the big challenge here now; queues for pcr make it impossible for many people and lots are just being turned away  home tests are very hard to find and theres price gauging  the demand for pcr is way over what can be handled  more home tests needed 
 snubs so theres a rapidly declining single digit percentage of people who cant  say  fly interstate or go to a bar but can do essential tasks  different story if their workplace requires vax  e g   hospitality   those folks need to decide between a free jab and a career change 
 snubs there was a time where vax supplies were low  but theyre now pretty readily available by all accounts  i certainly had no problems getting a booster last week   as such  weve now got one of the most vaxed populations in the world at 91 4  16+ doubled   
 snubs alright  more serious answer with the facts  last month  various states started requiring double vax for some venues such as pubs and restaurants  as well as those flying  anything essential  such as groceries  only requires check in 
 andypook  snubs its not really that bad; the kangaroos we used to ride to work have turned out to be excellent sources of protein for those in concentration camps    the excellent source of protein is the only even remotely true thing in this thread
